This directory contains ups templates for cmake.   
These templates support 32bit and 64bit SL4 and SL5.
They will need modification to support more flavors.
Writing version and table files for NULL flavored products is left as an exercise for the developer.

To use them,  where XXX is the product name:
1. cp generic.table.in XXX/ups/XXX.table.in
2. cp generic.version.in XXX/ups/XXX.version.in
3. Replace XXX in each file with your product name (e.g., art, fhiclcpp, etc.)
The ups convention is that product names will be all lower case.
Edit the list of required products in XXX.table.in.

See example/ToyCmake for a complete example which uses cmake to build hello world
and create a relocateable ups tarball.  
(As of right now, you have to build the tarball yourself, but that will change.)
